# CGS

## Introduction

Gangue, an important byproduct in the primitive coal production process, is the characteristic of low carbon and sulfur materials which, when burning, incurs damage to the environment. Inspired by the usage of the Near infrared spectroscopy in other fields successfully, we employ it here. In order to identify gangues from coals efficiently, we introduce two classification branches and propose an improved broad learning algorithm. Evaluations on testing samples show that the proposed method achieves the best performance with an accuracy of 99.01% and a testing time of 0.1141. More details can be seen in [1].

## Usage

1.The software of CGS was implemented in Matlab. Please ensure that you have installed Matlab software on your laptop and add to the PATH (the environmental variable). 
2. Notably, since some files are larger than 100M, we release them at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A4fc4iDcUJzKQGfa8S5QmlCHQexpFqAx. After downloading, please put the files in the CGS folder.
3. After downloading, please double-click on the file 'CGS.exe' to run the executable file：CGS.exe
4. Select a coal/gangue spectrum（such as open test.xlsx）for analysis.
5. Select the classification branches and the classification methods. The sample spectrum is visualized in the left of the interface and classification results are shown in the right of the interface.
